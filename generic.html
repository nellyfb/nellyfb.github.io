									<p>I was born and semi-raised in the Big Apple(a.k.a New York City). Then I moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania for high school. I found myself being completely dedicated to education and finished high school requirements for graduation in two years rather than four. I was only fifteen years old at the time and so ahead but was very lost and confused in what to do next. I was then offered to start an associate's degree of arts at my local college with a full-ride scholarship. I accepted and went to the main campus of our college during what should have been my eleventh(junior) and twelfth(senior) year of high school. This past month of May was my college graduation and I went on to be one of the only four students of my school to graduate from college before high school. Nearing graduation I decided I wanted to work in technology. </p>
									<p>I became so decided and sure I wanted to work in the technology field so I quickly started researching about potential careers in tech. As someone who enjoys and has background in art but wanted to learn coding and all the 'techy stuff', web development and design seemed the perfect introduction to technology and the careers in the field. I submitted my application to the YWEB Front-End Web Career Academy and was accepted a couple weeks later. I spent the summer after college graduation and my eighteenth birthday learning front-end web development and design. I have graduated the program since and have become proficient in HTML programming and CSS coding. I feel confident in design and I'm eager to expand my new career. </p>
